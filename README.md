# DL-IRC
An extensible JavaScript IRC bot developed with several node packages that can download videos off of YouTube.

## Dependences
DL-IRC is built to be run under node.js, so that will need to be installed on your system in order to run this. The bot also works using several node package manager packages. These include:  
* irc
	* Used to interface with IRC.
* youtube-dl
	* Used to download the file off of youtube as an MP4.
* youtube-node
	* Used to interface with the YouTube API to perform searches based on keyword.
